# Crossroads-Phantom Opera

"Crossroads-Phantom Opera" is an experimental performance that combines augmented reality technology with opera performance. It explores the possibilities of integrating cutting-edge technology with traditional performances, based on the classic Chinese Peking opera "Crossroads". In this performance, AR technology is used to recreate one of the core characters as a virtual phantom, who interacts with real opera actors during rehearsals and performances.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feed9bfc-eaf0-4322-b353-124a2b08fb1b)
